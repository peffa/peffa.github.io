            <!-- About me, needs formatting, web-spacing, and boil it down  -->
            <p>
              Growing up, my Father taught me how to build, use, and enjoy computers. He encouraged me to pursue
              Computer Science for my Bachelor's but I said no, "I don't want my hobby to be my job, because it won't be
              fun anymore." I wanted to help people, so I did Psychology to learn about them, worked in Sales to satisfy
              them, and now I want to code so I can build for them; the worldwide audience, accessible without leaving
              my home.

              I've been working in the cell phone industry for over 5 years and am interested in mobile app development.
              The concept of a device we have with us at all times, that's the platform with the furthest reach. The
              ability of code to reach multiple platforms with Unity means you create one and disperse to many
              platforms, this is it, the time has come for my hobby to become my career. If the market values what I
              love doing, that's a dream job, and I should pursue that.

              I have a circle of close friends across the United States with careers in different aspects of Computer
              Technology, from game development, business programs, databases, networking. Most of them are in Florida,
              but I also have Seattle, Louisiana, Ohio, and Texas. We would come together and I would joke, that their
              career was my hobby, so we always had tons to talk about and I made a lot of great friends.

              I was pursuing the Military for the last 10 years, but finally realized what I want to do with my life,
              and that means I don't need them to teach me a skill that I can base my career off of. I spoke to my
              family, and they are in full support of this being a career move, I am looking to go all in. I have
              already begun networking with my job to relocate at our closest location to Campus; I can't work
              part-time, but I can relocate, take a demotion, and work less. I want to take out loans to work the least
              I can, to focus as much as possible on coding while in School.

              I have a network of support through friends I can build with, literally get into this content on my free
              time; it interests me, I care about it. It's like being an artist with text that creates paintings for the
              world to see.

              ---
              I'm moving my job to a store closer to Campus, it's 11 minutes away according to Google Maps. One of my
              friends since high school actually graduated this boot camp from this location, he lives close by, he's
              essentially my mentor at this point. He introduced me to your program, we've gone over the syllabus, I've
              been able to see what he's working on; he has work and his side projects, just being able to see all the
              content first hand before the class begins gives me the confidence of knowing what I'm getting into and
              what's expected of me.

              Not only will the class structure provide me a community of people going through exactly what I am for the
              first time, but I have aces up sleeve of someone that recently graduated and friends out there that are
              doing similar work as their active career. I already have friends asking me if I'm going to learn SQL (for
              example) and they get all excited because that's what they use, then they show me all their stuff, and
              honestly I've been overwhelmed by my friend's excitement in hearing that I'm doing this and how much they
              want to share with me everything they know, my friends are very happy that I'm officially trying to enter
              their field.

              Dave, who recently graduated - first hand experience of job availability after graduation, he's working -
              he got it, he's good, swears by it. Give it your time, energy, effort, take it seriously, it's something
              you love, you want to do it, sacrifice everything you can to make it happen. I earned my bachelor's, then
              I entered the work force, realized what I wanted to do, and now it's time to go back to school for that
              trade skill, then my Psychology Degree will amplify it.

              Besides those resources, we have Self-Taught which just like the assessment, use Google, the answers are
              there, seek and you shall find. The boot camp is going to hold more accountability on my shoulders, if I
              get lost I will have a support group to correct me, at the end of the program I will have achieved not
              only a portfolio, but also the accredited completion, these are important to get hired. I am literally
              doing this for that, which makes me certain that I will graduate because I hadn't doubted it until you
              asked me, but failure has not been an option in my mind, which is why I have been excessively preparing to
              succeed, so that the probability of failure is as high as me being struck by lightning during the
              semester.

              Life is 90% preparation and 10% execution, with that being said, it's time to act and you can be certain,
              because I'm prepared.
